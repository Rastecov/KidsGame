Game Overview
KidsGame consists of six different levels that challenge your ability to order numbers and letters in ascending and descending order, identify the first and last letters from a set of letters, and identify the minimum and maximum numbers from a set of numbers. Each level has its own form that allows players to play with numbers from 0 to 100 and alphabet letters from a to z, lower case or/and uppercase.

To play the game, simply submit the form for each level with the correct order of numbers or letters. If you win the game, a button "Go to the Next Level" will appear for you to proceed to the next level. However, if you lose the game, a button "Try Again this Level" will appear for you to retry the current level.

If it's not the last level and you win the game, you will see a result message with a button "Sign Out" and "Stop this Session" to end your playing session. If it's the last level and you win the game, congratulations! You will see a result message with a button "Play Again", "Home Page", and "Sign Out" to end your playing session.

Please keep in mind that you only have six lives for each playing session. If you use up all your lives and fail to win the game, it's game over.
